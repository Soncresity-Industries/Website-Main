# Notes on the Notes

I think these are medical. Or were.

I found this on a dead terminal. Most of it goes over my head but I’ve been reading it every night trying to make sense of it.

## About the Heart Thing

He keeps talking about the heart like it’s important, not just because it pumps blood.

There’s stuff here about nerves. Signals. Feedback loops.

I think the thing sits there so it can:

- Feel when the body is scared
- Feel when it’s hurt
- Decide when to move

That means it knows.

## “Suppression”

This word keeps coming up.

Not control.  
Not replacement.

Suppression.

Like when you hold a button down so nothing else works.

If that’s true, then the people we see out there aren’t gone.

They’re just buried.

## There’s a Part I Don’t Like

One paragraph mentions “recognition without agency.”

I don’t know what that means exactly, but I think it explains why one of them stopped when it saw me.

Just for a second.

## Something About Eating Them

This part isn’t finished. Or it was removed.

But there’s a reference to “secondary implantation vectors” and “tissue survival post-mortem.”

I don’t think cooking helps.

I think it just makes us feel better.

I’m done reading this for tonight.
