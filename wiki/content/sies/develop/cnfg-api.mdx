<Callout title="Common API Changes" type="warning">
  Please be aware that, while we try to to deliver a good and easy-to-understand Configuration API, breaking changes are common for each **SI: Essentials** update, as the Cnfg API is actively being worked on and isn't finished yet!  
  If you need help updating, feel free to join our [Discord server](https://soncresity.industries/discord) or create a ticket on our [Support page](https://support.soncresity.industries).
