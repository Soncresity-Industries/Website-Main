<Callout title="Introduction" type="info">
  A fully functional Version of this class has first been introduced in Version `2.1.0`

The Singleplayer Utilities class allows check whether a `ServerPlayer` is the host of a Singleplayer World.
This may be useful when your Mod includes banning players but you don't want to ban the world host as otherwise their world **wouldn't get saved properly** and other players **would get kicked**.
