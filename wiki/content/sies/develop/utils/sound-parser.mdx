<Callout title="Introduction" type="info">
  A fully functional Version of this class has first been introduced in Version `2.1.0`
</Callout>

The Sound Parser class allows you to parse Sound IDs (you can find a list [**here**](https://www.soncresity.industries/utils/mc-registry)) to a `SoundEvent` which you can then use to either play a sound privately for one player or broadcast it across an entire dimension.


# Class
File: `SoundParser.java`
Package: `dev.soncresityindustries.es.api.util`

# Methods
## `parseSoundOrDefaultSuccess`
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
public static SoundEvent parseSoundOrDefaultSuccess(String name) {}
```
Parses the `SoundEvent` from a Sound ID (you can find a list [**here**](https://www.soncresity.industries/utils/mc-registry)) or defaults to [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_SUCCESS_ID`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-success-id) (or `sound_feedback_success_id`).

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
  Before [**SI: Essentials**](/sies) 2.2.0, this method would **always** return `SoundEvents.PLAYER_LEVELUP`!
</Callout>

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
SoundEvent soundEvent = SoundParser.parseSoundOrDefaultSuccess(soundID);
```

## `parseSoundOrDefaultFail`
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
public static SoundEvent parseSoundOrDefaultFail(String name) {}
```
Parses the `SoundEvent` from a Sound ID (you can find a list [**here**](https://www.soncresity.industries/utils/mc-registry)) or defaults to [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_FAIL_ID`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-fail-id) (or `sound_feedback_fail_id`).

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
  Before [**SI: Essentials**](/sies) 2.2.0, this method would **always** return `SoundEvents.NOTE_BLOCK_BASS`!
</Callout>

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
SoundEvent soundEvent = SoundParser.parseSoundOrDefaultFail(soundID);
```

## `parseSoundOrDefault`
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
public static SoundEvent parseSoundOrDefault(String soundID, @NotNull SoundEvent defaultSound) {}
```
Parses the `SoundEvent` from a Sound ID (you can find a list [**here**](https://www.soncresity.industries/utils/mc-registry)) or defaults to the specified `defaultSound` sound value.

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
SoundEvent soundEvent = SoundParser.parseSoundOrDefault(soundID, defaultSound);
```

## `forcePlaySound` (with `isPublic`)
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
public static void forcePlaySound(ServerPlayer player, SoundEvent soundEvent, float volume, float pitch, boolean isPublic) {}
```
Forces to play a sound privately or broadcasts it across the dimension of the player (depending on `isPublic`) regardless of [`ENABLE_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-sound-feedback) (or `enable_sound_feedback`).

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
SoundParser.forcePlaySound(player, soundEvent, volume, pitch, isPublic);
```

## `forcePlaySound`
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
public static void forcePlaySound(ServerPlayer player, SoundEvent soundEvent, float volume, float pitch) {}
```
Forces to play a sound privately or broadcasts it across the dimension of the player (depending on [`ENABLE_PUBLIC_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-public-sound-feedback)) (or `enable_pubic_sound_feedback`) regardless of [`ENABLE_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-sound-feedback) (or `enable_sound_feedback`).

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
SoundParser.forcePlaySound(player, soundEvent, volume, pitch);
```

## `playSound` (with `isPublic`)
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
public static void playSound(ServerPlayer player, SoundEvent soundEvent, float volume, float pitch, boolean isPublic) {}
```
Plays a sound privately or broadcasts it across the dimension of the player (depending on `isPublic`) while respecting the player's choice through [`ENABLE_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-sound-feedback) (or `enable_sound_feedback`).

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
SoundParser.playSound(player, soundEvent, volume, pitch, isPublic);
```

## `playSound`
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
public static void playSound(ServerPlayer player, SoundEvent soundEvent, float volume, float pitch) {}
```
Plays a sound privately or broadcasts it across the dimension of the player (depending on [`ENABLE_PUBLIC_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-public-sound-feedback) (or `enable_pubic_sound_feedback`)) while respecting the player's choice through [`ENABLE_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-sound-feedback) (or `enable_sound_feedback`).

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.2.0"
SoundParser.playSound(player, soundEvent, volume, pitch);
```

## `playSuccessSound`
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
public static void playSuccessSound(ServerPlayer player) {}
```
Plays the parsed [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_SUCCESS_ID`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-success-id) (or `sound_feedback_success_id`) sound privately or broadcasts it across the dimension of the player (depending on [`ENABLE_PUBLIC_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-public-sound-feedback) (or `enable_pubic_sound_feedback`)) with the volume of [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_SUCCESS_VOLUME`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-success-volume) (or `sound_feedback_success_volume`) and pitch of [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_SUCCESS_PITCH`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-success-pitch) (or `sound_feedback_success_pitch`) while respecting the player's choice through [`ENABLE_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-sound-feedback) (or `enable_sound_feedback`).

### Usage [!toc]
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
SoundParser.playSuccessSound(player);
```

## `playFailSound`
```java tab="sies >=2.1.0"
public static void playFailSound(ServerPlayer player) {}
```
Plays the parsed [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_FAIL_ID`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-fail-id) (or `sound_feedback_fail_id`) sound privately or broadcasts it across the dimension of the player (depending on [`ENABLE_PUBLIC_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-public-sound-feedback) (or `enable_pubic_sound_feedback`)) with the volume of [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_FAIL_VOLUME`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-fail-volume) (or `sound_feedback_fail_volume`) and pitch of [`SOUND_FEEDBACK_FAIL_PITCH`](/sies/configuration#sound-feedback-fail-pitch) (or `sound_feedback_fail_pitch`) while respecting the player's choice through [`ENABLE_SOUND_FEEDBACK`](/sies/configuration#enable-sound-feedback) (or `enable_sound_feedback`).
