<Callout title="Warning for developers updating from sies 2.2.0 to 2.3.0" type="warning">
  In version 2.3.0 of **SI: Essentials**, the `DebugLogger` got merged into the `Logger` class to avoid confusion.  
  Please update your `DebugLogger.debug()` references to `MYMOD.LOGGER.debug()` while `LOGGER` is the Logger instance in your main Mod class. ([More Info](#getting-started))
</Callout>

# Our custom Logger
**SI: Essentials** comes with a custom logger, that is based on the `slf4j` logger that is commonly used in Minecraft Mods.  
With our setup, we allow to create separate log files for each world that only contain the output of your mod. This makes finding issues in your code faster.  

Our logger also comes with a debug option that is controlled with the global [`debug_enabled` value of the SI: Essentials Common Cnfg](/sies/general-configuration#debug_enabled). While debug output is only visible depending on that value in the Minecraft logs, debug output will **always** be logged to your custom logfile that was explained above.

## Getting Started
To start using our logger, simply create a public Logger field that uses the Logger class from `dev.soncresityindustries.api.logger`:
```java
import dev.soncresityindustries.es.api.logger.Logger;

public static final String MOD_ID = "my_mod";
public static final Logger LOGGER = new Logger(MOD_ID);
```

<Callout title="Design Choice" type="info">
  We designed this logger in its current form to enable a seamless and efficient migration to our Logging System.  
  Its methods mirror those of the original `slf4j` Logger while providing additional functionality.
</Callout>

Now everything is set up to continue with the **File Logger**.

## File Logger
As mentioned previously, we support creating custom log files, just for your own mod output.
You can choose the location of that file freely inside a world folder.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  We might introduce a file logger that is created on game launch instead of on world launch in the future.  
  Therefore we would like to hear your feedback about this in our [Discord Server](https://soncresity.industries/discord).
</Callout>

Due to Events being different on Fabric and NeoForge, you have to set them up differently, while the functionality stays the same.

**Method:**
```java tab="sies >=2.3.0"
public void initializeFileLogging(@NotNull MinecraftServer server, @NotNull String path, @NotNull String filePrefix) {}
```
```java tab="sies 2.2.0"
public void initializeFileLogging(@NotNull MinecraftServer server, @NotNull String modID) {}
```

### Fabric
```java tab="sies >=2.3.0"
@Override
public void onInitialize() {
    ServerLifecycleEvents.SERVER_STARTING.register((server) -> {
        // "modid/logs" will result in this path: "/<mcRoot>/saves/<world>/modid/logs"
        // The logfile will be named "<MODID>-log-dd.MM.yyyy_HH-mm-ss.log"
        // Since sies 2.3.0 you can customize the location of the file a well as its file name.
        LOGGER.initializeFileLogging(server, "modid/logs", MODID);
    });

    ServerLifecycleEvents.SERVER_STOPPED.register(server -> {
        LOGGER.close();
    });
}
```
```java tab="sies 2.2.0"
// Not recommended in terms of customizability. Please update to 2.3.0.
@Override
public void onInitialize() {
    ServerLifecycleEvents.SERVER_STARTING.register((server) -> {
        // This will result in this path: "/<mcRoot>/saves/<world>/modid/logs"
        // The logfile will be named "<MODID>-log-dd.MM.yyyy_HH-mm-ss.log"
        LOGGER.initializeFileLogging(server, MODID);
    });

    ServerLifecycleEvents.SERVER_STOPPED.register(server -> {
        LOGGER.close();
    });
}
```

### NeoForge
```java tab="sies >=2.3.0"
@SubscribeEvent
public void onServerStarting(ServerStartingEvent event) {
    // "modid/logs" will result in this path: "/<mcRoot>/saves/<world>/modid/logs"
    // The logfile will be named "<MODID>-log-dd.MM.yyyy_HH-mm-ss.log"
    // Since sies 2.3.0 you can customize the location of the file a well as its file name.
    LOGGER.initializeFileLogging(event.getServer(), "modid/logs", MODID);
}

@SubscribeEvent
public void onServerStopping(ServerStoppingEvent event) {
    LOGGER.close();
}
```
```java tab="sies 2.2.0"
// Not recommended in terms of customizability. Please update to 2.3.0.
@SubscribeEvent
public void onServerStarting(ServerStartingEvent event) {
    // This will result in this path: "/<mcRoot>/saves/<world>/modid/logs"
    // The logfile will be named "<MODID>-log-dd.MM.yyyy_HH-mm-ss.log"
    LOGGER.initializeFileLogging(event.getServer(), MODID);
}

@SubscribeEvent
public void onServerStopping(ServerStoppingEvent event) {
    LOGGER.close();
}
```

## Conclusion
Now your file logger should be set up and you can use `LOGGER.info()`, `LOGGER.warn()`, `LOGGER.error()` and `LOGGER.debug()`.  
All mod output will be saved to the file you specified above if it's loaded.
