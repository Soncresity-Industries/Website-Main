## Summary

The organism does not behave like a virus or bacterium.  
It demonstrates **goal-oriented replication** and selective interaction with host systems.

Primary implantation occurs **adjacent to the heart**, interfacing with the cardiac plexus and vagus nerve.

This location provides:

- Continuous oxygenated blood supply
- Immediate access to autonomic signaling
- Redundancy against localized trauma

The host remains biologically alive throughout all observed stages.

## Neurological Effects (Early)

Initial symptoms are subtle:

- Heightened appetite
- Restlessness
- Reduced fear response
- Emotional blunting

EEG readings indicate **no loss of higher brain function**.

Instead, we observe *signal suppression*.

The host is not erased.  
The host is **muted**.

## Motor Control Anomaly

Motor output is overridden without corresponding cortical shutdown.

This suggests:

- Paralysis of voluntary control
- Preservation of awareness

In one subject, lacrimal response was observed during aggressive behavior.

No pain response was registered.

---

## Preliminary Conclusion

The organism does not kill the host.

Death would terminate oxygen flow and halt replication.

The body is repurposed as:

- A transport system
- A nutrient reservoir
- A reproductive environment

Further ethical review pending.
