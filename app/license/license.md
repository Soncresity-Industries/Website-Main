# Soncresity Standard License (SSL)

**Version 1.0 — 2025**

Copyright (c) Soncresity Industries and its Contributors

---

## 1. Overview
The Soncresity Standard License (SSL) is a dual‑mode license designed to support the needs of Soncresity Industries (SI) while also providing a clear and permissive structure for external developers.

The SSL operates in two modes:
- **SI Mode (Internal Use by Soncresity Industries):** All rights reserved unless explicitly granted. SI maintains full control over distribution, modification, and commercial usage, with limited permissions granted to the public for intended use cases.
- **Open Source Mode (External Use):** For non‑SI developers who adopt this license for their own projects, the SSL behaves as a permissive, open‑source license.

This license applies to **software projects of any kind**, including but not limited to applications, libraries, frameworks, game modifications, servers, assets, scripts, and development tools.

---

## 2. Definitions
- **"Project"** refers to the software, code, assets, or related materials licensed under the SSL.
- **"SI"** refers to Soncresity Industries, including its teams, contributors, and authorized developers.
- **"You"** refers to any user, developer, or organization accessing, using, or distributing the Project.
- **"Intended Use"** refers to usage that aligns with the normal purpose of the Project (e.g., using a Minecraft mod in a modpack, creating videos about the software, integrating a library into an application).

---

## 3. Permissions for the Public (SI Mode)
When the Project is authored by Soncresity Industries, the following permissions are granted:

### 3.1 Allowed Actions
You are permitted to:
- Use the Project for its **intended purposes**.
- Include the Project in **modpacks**, plugin collections, distributions, or software bundles, provided the Project is not modified beyond configuration or integration requirements.
- Create **social media content** (e.g., YouTube videos, TikToks, streams, reviews, showcases, tutorials) featuring or discussing the Project.
- Link to official SI downloads, pages, or documentation.

### 3.2 Restricted Actions
You **may not**:
- Modify, fork, translate, or reverse engineer the Project without explicit written permission from SI.
- Redistribute modified versions.
- Sell or commercially profit from the Project or its assets.
- Claim authorship or imply partnership with SI.
- Use SI branding, logos, or identity assets without written permission.

### 3.3 Clarification
Unless explicitly permitted, **all rights are reserved by SI**. Only the actions in Section 3.1 are allowed.

---

## 4. Permissions for Non‑SI Developers (Open Source Mode)
When a developer or organization that is **not** part of Soncresity Industries chooses to license their own project under the SSL, the following open‑source permissions apply:

### 4.1 Allowed Actions
Users may:
- Use the Project for any purpose.
- Modify the Project.
- Distribute original or modified versions.
- Include the Project in commercial or non‑commercial software.
- Create derivative works.

### 4.2 Requirements
When distributing or modifying the Project, users must:
- Include this license.
- Provide attribution to the original authors.
- Clearly state changes when distributing modified versions.

### 4.3 Limitations
- The software is provided **"as‑is"** with no warranties.
- The authors are not liable for damages arising from use of the software.

---

## 5. Warranty Disclaimer
THE PROJECT IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.

---

## 6. Liability Limitation
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROJECT.

---

## 7. Branding and Identity
This license does **not** grant permission to use SI trademarks, logos, branding elements, or visual identity in any form unless explicitly granted in writing.

---

## 8. Dual‑Mode Clarification
The mode of license application depends solely on the authorship:
- **Projects authored by Soncresity Industries** use **SI Mode (Sections 3 + 7)**.
- **Projects authored by third parties under SSL** use **Open Source Mode (Sections 4 + 5 + 6)**.

No project can operate in both modes simultaneously.
